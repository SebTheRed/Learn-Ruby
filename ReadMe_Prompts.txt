READ ME:

These prompts are generated using Chat GPT.
I then take one of these prompts, append it to the prefix "lesson:", and then feed it to Chat GPT 
Chat GPT bot returns 2-3 paragraphs, one code example, and one coding challenge.
Everything it returns is relevant to the supplied sentence prompt.

How to make your own Ruby Tutor:
Step 1: Intoduce yourself to bot and tell it that its purpose is to teach you Ruby.
Step 2: Tell it what programming knowledge you have, so it can assume your algo & abstraction knowledge.
  This is important to ensure the vocabulary the bot is using meets the understanding of the user.
Step 2: Continue to feed it this prompt & prod it in the right direction, until it reiterates a tutorial-like response that you desire. Be kind to the bot.
    When a string follows "lesson:" take that string and return 2-3 paragraphs of information on the Ruby concept.
    Also return 1 code example.
    Also return 1 challenge relevant to the prompt concept. Do you understand?
Step 3: Copy and paste (life-hack: use ctrl + c then ctrl + v) one of these prompts.
  Then append it to the string "lesson:" in the beginning of the prompt to the bot.
  i.e. "lesson: Ruby is an object-oriented programming language."
  Lastly give it to the bot!
Step 4: ??
Step 5: Profit

NOTE: I have found that the more I train and prompt the bot, the more correct, accurate, and uniform its reponses.
  Be sure not to use this bot for any other purpose, it can throw off the training.
NOTE: The bot made these prompts not me, so don't blame me if anything here is innacurate.
